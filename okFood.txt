// Title
	- okFood

// What this project should include 

	- Firebase
		- Database, Authentication, Notifications, Cloud Functions, Storage

	- Bottom Navigation View for multiple tabs/fragments

	- Take photos/read photos from memory
		~ Perhaps be able to alter/filter photos in app
	
	- Have at least one view where you can endless scroll


// Concept

	- Cooking app

	- "kind of like reddit and tinder had a baby that wanted to be a cooking/receipe app"

	- users can post a receipe with ingredients and instructions
	
		~ other users can view those posts, upvote (perhaps downvote), favorite, write comments

	- users will have the option to view posts in a regular news feed type of view
	or they can set filters and preferences to match with food receipes, nearby restaurants, delivery options
		~ completely wild idea is swiping through events that users list (sort of like food parties)

// How to accomplish this 

	- Firebase Database will save posts, vote-counts, comments, etc. 

	- Firebase Storage will hold images/videos that users post

	- Firebase Authentication will be used to let users sign in/out, have usernames

	- Firebase Notifications will be sent when comments are made on posts/ a good "food match" is out there

	- Firebae Cloud Functions will be used to send data to ElasticSearch

	- Taking photos/reading photos from memory will be used to make posts and profile pictures

	- Bottom Navigation view will be used to switch between Matching, News Feed and Profile tabs

	- Endless Scroll we use when viewing the news feed tab
